# FrameShifter â€” Elite Dangerous Dashboards and Overlays

FrameShifter is a tool for displaying Elite Dangerous dashboards and overlays.

Extendable with HTML/CSS/JS, FrameShifter makes consuming data from status files and player journals easy.

FrameShifter works by hosting a local web server alongside the Elite Dangerous. This server reads your Elite Dangerous status files and player journal, and sends it to connected browser dashboards via websockets!
